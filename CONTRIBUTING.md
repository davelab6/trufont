# Contribution Guidelines

## Issues and Ideas

To post an issue, search the existing open and closed issues and pull requests for your topic to learn if it has already been discussed. 

<https://github.com/trufont/trufont/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=TOPIC>

However, always open new issues for new topics. 
You can always refer to previous issues/pulls using their ID number, either with their full URL, or simply prepending hash, eg `#10`

To save yourself wasted effort, its a good idea to post an issue proposing a change, before implementing it and contributing code. 

## Contributing Directly

Fork the repo, make a branch, and commit your changes. 
Then make a pull request at <https://github.com/trufont/trufont/pulls>
